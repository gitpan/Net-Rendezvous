KNOWN BUGS

 - Some special characters in domain names may not be parsed properly via Net::DNS.
   The pure perl implementation of dn_expand in Net::DNS can misinterpt some characters. 
   The XS implementation using dn_expand in libc can cause Net::DNS packet decoding
   subroutines to fail completely.
